# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
require 'faker'
 

# 30.times do
    # p instructor = Instructor.create!(
    #   first_name: Faker::Name.first_name,
    #   last_name: Faker::Name.last_name,
    #   age: rand(30..60),
    #   salary: rand(60..120) * 1000,
    #   highest_level_of_education: education_level[2..-1].sample
    # )
